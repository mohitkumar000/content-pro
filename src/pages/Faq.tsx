  { q: "Can you also help me start a face channel?", a: "Yes! If you choose a face channel, weâ€™ll provide you with a word-by-word script. All you need to do is record yourself reading it on camera. Our team will handle editing, thumbnail design, and complete channel management." },
  { q: "How will you help me choose the right niche?", a: "During the onboarding call, our experts will guide you based on your passion, interests, and profit potential. Weâ€™ll also show real examples of viral channels that monetized within a month, so you can pick the best niche with confidence." },
  { q: "Who handles the content research?", a: "Our research team constantly tracks trends and analyzes YouTube content around the clock. You donâ€™t need to worry about topics â€” weâ€™ll deliver high-quality, trend-backed videos on time." },
  { q: "Do you also create YouTube Shorts?", a: "Yes, our team is capable of creating Shorts. While we donâ€™t have a fixed Shorts policy, we can tailor it to your needs and decide together during the call." },
  { q: "Can I take only scripting or editing services instead of a full package?", a: "Absolutely. If you need just one or two services, you can discuss your requirements on a call. Weâ€™ll create a custom package for you at a lower price." },
  { q: "Whatâ€™s included in the mentorship program?", a: "Our mentorship calls share secret strategies, growth frameworks, and proven work ethics. Many students from our mentorship program have achieved incredible results. These calls are included in our $3000/month package." },
  { q: "Do you also handle brand deals, sponsorships, or affiliate marketing?", a: "Yes, our team works with multiple clients on brand deals, sponsorships, product promotions, and affiliate marketing. These advanced services are included in the $3000/month package." },
  { q: "Can you guarantee results on YouTube?", a: "YouTube is unpredictable, so we donâ€™t guarantee results. However, 95% of our clients have achieved success with us. Even those who didnâ€™t see quick results appreciated our guidance and mentorship. If you want, we can connect you with past clients for honest feedback." },
  { q: "Do you offer refunds?", a: "No. We follow a strict no-refund policy because we clarify everything in the onboarding call and show you demos before you pay. Once we start, our team invests significant effort and resources into your channel." },
  { q: "Will I need to share my YouTube login details?", a: "No. If you already have a channel, we only request manager access. If you donâ€™t have one, weâ€™ll guide you to create a new channel and then simply make us the manager." },
  { q: "Can I run both faceless and face channels at the same time?", a: "Yes, we can create a custom package for you if you want both. You can also upgrade or downgrade your plan anytime. Our 24/7 support ensures that any issue is resolved within 24 hours through a single email." },
